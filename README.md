# Test by Mobile

Test By Step is a free, open-source study aid for professional IT certifications. There are no sign-ups, no subscriptions, no fees, no tracking, and no obligations. It synchronizes study content by downloading directly from Github for offline access and can (hopefully) be used entirely offline.

Test By Step aims to deliver succinct and accurate study resources based directly on the test objectives specified in the proponent organizations released material. Test By Step study resources aim to provide a easily digestible studying environment that focuses on the aspects of certification tests which are directly testable rather than anecdotal or highly contextual. 

This resource is not a drop in repacement for other commercial study resources (e.g. ITProTV or Jason Dion) which provide generally useful context and anecdotes that are valuable but not applicable to performance on test day.

## Why Test By Step?

Certification proponent organizations release generally clear test objectives and have become much better at adhering strictly to the bounds defined in those objectives. Video courses on the subject are very useful for understanding the subject but are lengthy and include supplementary commentary that make returning for further study impractical.

My goal is that Test By Step fills that void by improving quick look up capability, word and phrase association improvement, and clearly identifying the need to know aspects by domain for each test by directly referencing the published test objectives.

Additionally, the application landscape for good study tools is bloated with subscriptions, tracking, and advertisements for a product that isn't significantly better than googling each domain objective individually. I hope to solve that with a decent free and open tool.
